# ToDo-List
to do list with login and registration using php and mysql

I have used phpmyadmin (XAMPP).
the database file is also attached.

--------------------------------------------

1) Place the 'last' folder in your "[local disk where xampp is installed]:\xampp\htdocs"
2) upload the tables from "login_register_pure_coding" database file placed in 'last' folder to 'localhost/phpmyadmin'.
3) now open the website using link: "localhost/last/index.php".
4) Register your account.
5) login then.
6) and you'll get a welcome page with ToDo list.
7) enter your task title, label and priority and press add button.
8) to remove the task press button "x" on the top left corner of the Task title.
9) to signout, click on the signout button on the top right of the page.
